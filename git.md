# Git and GitHub

__INFO: Not really needed anymore . . .__

Simple reminders to manage a project with Git and GitHub interface.

## Clone a project from my personal GitHub account:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jlengrand&/projet.git
```

## Clone a project from another source:

```bash
$ git clone git://git.berlios.de/gpsd
```

## Push modifications previously locally committed:

Should be performed once in a while to keep remote repository up to date. Do not forget to pull before pushing to avoid conflicts.

```bash
$ git push -origin master
```

More information can be found in git documentation

__**INFO :** No need to create a folder first, as a main folder is automatically created for the project.__
